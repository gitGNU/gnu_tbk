	Description : 
Tabarnak is a free PHP software written with the Zend Framework and the Smarty's template engine distrubuted under GPL v2.
He works on a module architecture, independent of the database engine and structure (you can use an existing one for Tabarnak).
Tabarnak is the base part of a helpdesk on which you can plug some module to add some features.
Started for a school project, we wants to open the source code and find some contributers.
Each part of the documentation would be distributed under Creative Commons licence and written with DocBook format.
